# USWildfireAnalysis
Wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015

Created by [Chance Robinson](https://github.com/RobinsonCW), [Jeff Washburn](https://github.com/jwashbur65) and [Sreeni Prabhala](https://github.com/sreenip06)

## Purpose
Given the size, location and date, can you predict the cause of a wildfire?


## Analysis Files

* [US Wildfire Analysis](https://github.com/RobinsonCW/USWildfireAnalysis/blob/master/src/objectives/python/USWildfireAnalysis.ipynb): A paper covering the analysis.


## Presentations

* [US Wildfire Cloud Predictions (Power Point)](https://github.com/RobinsonCW/USWildfireAnalysis/blob/master/presentation/DS7346_Cloud_Computing_Presentation.pptx):  A power point presentation covering our usage of cloud resources to make machine learning predictions with the US Wildfire data set.


## Codebook
The [Codebook](https://github.com/RobinsonCW/PUBGFinishPlacementAnalysis/blob/master/CodeBook.md) provides additional details regarding the session information of the environment.


## Data

The dataset [readme](https://github.com/RobinsonCW/USWildfireAnalysis/blob/master/data/README.md) provides a reference for the source files.

* [`FPA_FOD_20170508_SAMPLE.CSV`](https://github.com/RobinsonCW/USWildfireAnalysis/blob/master/data/FPA_FOD_20170508_SAMPLE.CSV):  38 features + target.
